"""The schema of a TensorStore specifies key properties of the format in a 
uniform way that is independent of where and how the data is actually stored. 
When creating a TensorStore, schema constraints and preferences may be specified; 
the driver combines these constraints with any driver-specific constraints/defaults 
to choose a suitable schema automatically. When opening an existing TensorStore, 
its schema is validated against any constraints that are specified."""

    A chunk layout specifies a hierarchical regular grid with up to three levels:

    Args:
        - rank : integer[0, 32]Â¶
            Number of dimensions.
            The rank is always a hard constraint. It is redundant to specify the 
            rank if any other field that implicitly specifies the rank is included.
        - grid_origin : array of integer | null
            Specifies hard constraints on the origin of the chunk grid.
            The length must equal the rank of the index space. Each element constrains 
            the grid origin for the corresponding dimension. A value of null 
            (or, equivalently, -9223372036854775808) indicates no constraint.
        - grid_origin_soft_constraint : array of integer | null
            Specifies preferred values for the origin of the chunk grid rather than hard constraints.
            If a non-null value is specified for a given dimension in both grid_origin_soft_constraint 
            and grid_origin, the value in grid_origin takes precedence.
        - inner_order : array of integer
            Permutation specifying the element storage order within the innermost chunks.
            This must be a permutation of [0, 1, ..., rank-1]. Lexicographic order 
            (i.e. C order/row-major order) is specified as [0, 1, ..., rank-1], while colexicographic 
            order (i.e. Fortran order/column-major order) is specified as [rank-1, ..., 1, 0].
        - inner_order_soft_constraint : array of integer
            Specifies a preferred value for inner_order rather than a hard constraint. 
            If inner_order is also specified, it takes precedence.
        - write_chunk : ChunkLayout/Grid
            Constraints on the chunk grid over which writes may be efficiently partitioned.
        - read_chunk : ChunkLayout/Grid
            Constraints on the chunk grid over which reads may be efficiently partitioned.

            Constraints on the chunk grid used by the codec, if applicable.

            Specifies the data type of the TensorStore.
            The data type is always a hard constraint.
        - domain : IndexDomain
            Domain of the TensorStore, including bounds and optional dimension labels.
            The domain is always a hard constraint, except that a labeled dimension is 
            allowed to match an unlabeled dimension, and an implicit, infinite bound is

        - chunk_layout : ChunkLayout
            Data storage layout constraints.
            The rank of the chunk layout must match the rank of the schema. When merging

            When merging schema constraints objects, the codec constraints are merged recursively.
        - fill_value
            Fill value to use for missing data.

        - dimension_units : array of Unit | null
            Physical units of each dimension.
            Specifies the physical quantity corresponding to an increment of 1 index along 
            each dimension, i.e. the resolution. The length must match the rank of the schema. 
            Specifying null for a dimension indicates that the unit is unknown.
